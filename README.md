## 💡 My Study Approach
Timeline

Total Study Duration: 2 Weeks of focus study
Daily Commitment: 2-3 hours per day on weekdays, 4-5 hours on weekends, 8 hours a day before the exam

Study Strategy

Video Course Completion: Watched the entire 14-hour freeCodeCamp course, taking detailed notes
Hands-On Practice: Created a free AWS account and practiced with services in the Free Tier
Note Organization: Organized notes by exam domain for easy review
Active Recall: Used flashcards and self-quizzing to reinforce concepts
Practice Exams: Took multiple practice tests to identify weak areas
Review and Revision: reviewed all notes and retaking weak sections

What Worked Best

Breaking down the 14-hour course into manageable 1-2 hour study sessions
Immediately practicing concepts in the AWS console after learning them
Creating comparison charts for similar services (e.g., S3 vs. EBS vs. EFS)
Understanding the "why" behind AWS services, not just memorizing features
Focusing on use cases and scenarios rather than just technical specifications

## 🛠️ Hands-On Practice Projects
During my preparation, I created several mini-projects to reinforce learning:

Set up a basic VPC with public and private subnets
Deployed a static website on S3 with CloudFront
Created IAM users, groups, and policies
Launched and configured EC2 instances
Explored different S3 storage classes and lifecycle policies
Set up CloudWatch alarms and billing alerts

## 📈 Exam Experience
Preparation Tips

Understand the AWS Shared Responsibility Model thoroughly

Don't let your computer crash in the middle of the exam like me 😔
Read each question carefully and identify key requirements
Use process of elimination for difficult questions
Flag uncertain questions for review
Manage time effectively (90 minutes for 65 questions)
Stay calm and trust your preparation
